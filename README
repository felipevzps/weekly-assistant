1. About
----------------
just a simple automation tool to generate and update my weekly task notes using data from Google Calendar.  

2. What it does?
----------------
* reads my upcoming Google Calendar events (next 7 days)  
* parses unfinished tasks from previous weekly notes  
* generates a new note using my custom weekly obsidian template  

3. Why?
----------------
manually managing recurring tasks is so boring... and it became time-consuming and error-prone.  
this tool automates the entire process, so I can start each week with an organized planning note,  
without manually copy-pasting or missing important events.  

4. Usage
----------------
$ conda env create -n weekly-assistant -f environment.yaml
$ conda activate weekly-assistant

$ python weekly_assistant/main.py --weekly        # to manage my weekly notes
$ python weekly_assistant/main.py --daily         # for adding new events during the week

5. Automation with cron
----------------
# runs weekly-assistant every Monday at 04:00 AM (this creates a new weekly note for me)
0 4 * * 1 /home/felipevzps/weekly-assistant/weekly_assistant/main.py --weekly

# runs weekly-assistant everyday at 05:00 AM (this updates my weekly note with daily events)
0 5 * * * /home/felipevzps/weekly-assistant/weekly_assistant/main.py --daily
