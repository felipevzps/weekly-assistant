just a simple automation tool to generate and update my weekly task notes using data from Google Calendar and past task logs from my obsidian vault.

# what it does?
* reads my upcoming Google Calendar events (next 7 days)
* parses unfinished tasks and future notes from previous weekly notes
* generates a new weekly note using my weekly obsidian template

# why?
managing recurring tasks manually is so boring... and it became time-consuming and error-prone.  
this tool automates the entire process, so I can start each week with an organized and updated planning note, without manually copy-pasting or missing events.

# usage
python weekly_assistant/main.py
