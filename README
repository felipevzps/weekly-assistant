1. About
----------------
just a simple automation tool to generate and update my weekly task notes using data from Google Calendar and past task logs from my obsidian vault.

2. What it does?
----------------
* reads my upcoming Google Calendar events (next 7 days)
* parses unfinished tasks and future notes from previous weekly notes
* generates a new weekly note using my weekly obsidian template

3. Why?
----------------
managing recurring tasks manually is so boring... and it became time-consuming and error-prone.  
this tool automates the entire process, so I can start each week with an organized and updated planning note, without manually copy-pasting or missing events.

4. Usage
----------------
$ conda env create -n weekly-assistant -f environment.yaml
$ conda activate weekly-assistant
$ python weekly_assistant/main.py --weekly                  # to manage my weekly notes
$ python weekly_assistant/main.py --daily                   # for adding new events during the week
